## Project Idea
**Whitetik** is an innovative platform for ticket sales that aims to prevent fraud and protect users from the black market for tickets. The platform provides technical solutions to verify ticket status and manage ticket trading securely and legally.

### Key Features
1. **Ticket Status Verification**:
   - Generates a unique code for each ticket based on the event ID and user ID.
   - Buyers can use this code to verify the ticket status before purchase, where the ticket status will be either "Available" or "Unavailable."

2. **Ticket State Management**:
   - **Available**: When the ticket is bought normally, without changing the buyer’s details.
   - **Unavailable**: When the buyer’s details are changed once, preventing further resale.

3. **Barcode Visibility Control**:
   - The barcode will only be visible when the ticket holder is within the event area on the day of the event, reducing the chances of fraud.

4. **Limiting Ticket Resales**:
   - Users are allowed to resell a maximum of 5 tickets over 10 days.
   - Exceeding this limit categorizes them as "black market traders," and they are banned from purchasing tickets for one month.
